Sleep and diet have a huge effect on decision-making[^1][^2], in a way that's really difficult to recognize in the
moment. When you're tired, the chocolate looks more tempting than the running shoes; when your blood sugar is low,
the TV looks more tempting than the job applications. If you're sleep-deprived and you're eating poorly, then trying
to achieve an end goal is like running a marathon with a pair of koalas stubbornly wrapped around your legs. I
mean, if you work hard you can probably do it, but... don't you think you should probably deal with those koalas
first? Maybe you can lure them off of you with some eucalyptus leaves?

Exactly how much sleep you *ought to* be getting seems to vary from person to person. The best advice I've found on
that front is to wake up before your alarm: set it as late as you're willing to get up, then dial back your bedtime
until you're reliably waking up before your alarm every morning. Then, once you're caught up, you mind find it much
harder to fall asleep without the help of that chronic sleep deprivation. *Ignore the temptation that this just means
you're not tired yet and you should stay up later.* What's much more likely is that those bright lights and screens
are keeping you awake in a way that they weren't before. You may need to carve out a half-hour of quiet time before
bed in order to get good and sleepy.

This process admittedly sucks; if you've accumulated a sleep debt, it might take a week of 9-10 hour nights before
you settle out, and if you're carving out even *more* time to screen-free before bed, you can end up heading to bed
practically as soon as you've finished the dishes from dinner. Just ride it out.

As far as food goes, there is *waaay* less consensus around what the "right" thing to be doing is, and that's putting
it lightly. In any case, we're not talking about a perfect diet here, just some basics like:

* Avoid really greasy, salty foods;
* Eat veggies with every meal (a fistful of spinach in a fruit smoothie is a great way to do this in the morning);
* Avoid empty carbs (sugars, cereal, white bread, etc).

In my experience the last one is the most helpful: when you eat empty carbs, they're easily digested and it leads to
a short spike of energy---followed by a crash a few hours later. Protein, fats, and carbs that are high in fibre
(like fruit or whole grains) digest more slowly, providing a more stable source of energy through the day. This
helps keep your mood and willpower stable too.

When you have these two things taken care of, it feels like a cheat code for motivation; tasks that used to be
impossible to stick to become practically effortless by comparison. Then, if you're like me, at some point you'll
inevitably convince yourself it's worth staying up late to get something done, or eating 8 Oreos to treat yourself,
and you'll realize your habits are slipping. No matter, just refocus on the basics: eat well and sleep.
