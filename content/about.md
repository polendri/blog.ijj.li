My name is Paul, and I write code in the Great White North. I got my BMath at UWaterloo and since then I've been mostly
doing full-stack web development. On the side, I spend a lot of time with Rust and functional programming.

As a carbon-based organic life form just like you, I stop coding sometimes to read, run, game, walk my dog, and fit in
quality time with my very busy wife.

Most of what I work on can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/pshendry).

Shoot me an email (paul at ijj.li) if you've got something to share! No spam, schemes, or related villainy please.
